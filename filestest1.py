# book answer uses max and min functions. makes sense, and makes the whole thing shorter/more
# straightforward, but i opted to write it out long here to recall and practice with some odds
# and ends i haven't touched for a bit. in a non-practice environment i would have looked up
# and utilized the min and max functions instead of making a for loop to cover it.

# book answer also uses a for loop to redefine every number in the dataset as an integer before
# plugging them into the min/max functions inside the print statement. considering the way it's
# being used with the min/max functions, this works fine. probably says something about the
# book answers that there's an unclosed parenthesis causing a syntax error though. did they really
# not double check that the answers work correctly in their own activecode environment?


# At the bottom of this page is a very long file called mystery.txt The lines of this file contain 
# either the word UP or DOWN or a pair of numbers. UP and DOWN are instructions for a turtle to 
# lift up or put down its tail. The pairs of numbers are some x,y coordinates. Write a program 
# that reads the file mystery.txt and uses the turtle to draw the picture described by the commands 
# and the set of points.

## Primary hangup on this was forgetting to reference the correct variable during the if statements,
## accidentally calline 'line' instead of 'contents' when looking for "UP" and "DOWN". gotta avoid
## autopilot when typing out variables!
